# MeteorVK

A basic Vulkan renderer that can load and handle multiple models and basic materials. Capable of shadow mapping and SSAO. Still planning on developing more features and plenty of restructuring left to do.
Current PBR shader code is borrowed from [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) for testing purposes, will change it back to my own Blinn implementation after some material testing.
